    <p>I've been busy with this project for half a year, its idea originates from Town of Salem, Mafia and DnD, the
      style of UI were taken from my last game AnotherPlanet.</p>
    <p>The game is basically about strategy and communication, in this game you will play various roles of different
      abilities and features. Also it includes single(offline) mode and multiple(online) mode and the link is here <a
        href="game/noa.apk">DOWNLOAD</a></p>
    <p>There are some pictures screenshoted from this game below and for more information you will see in the
      collections.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="inbox">

  </div>

  <div class="inpara">
    <p>As you've seen above, this is a list of characters which you would find in collections on the start menu. Click
      into it to see more details of each role.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="inbox">

  <div class="inpara">
    <p>The game has different modes, which is consisted of specific story, scene, and characters. before you truly get

  <div class="inpara">
    <p>It is the main scene of this game, below the toolbar are players' seats. The photos were produced by AI, not real
      humans. The green box shows which one you plays.</p>
    <p>The main box contains the majority of issues that takes place in this game, including conversations, events,
      timeline tips and what you've seen the lynch, whcih every player mainly take part in this game, players would vote
      for guilty. After discussion and reasoning we believe that everyone has got their own vote for lynch the evil.. On
      the right of screen lays two boxs, top is alignments, which means a group that you belong and bottom contains
      character features that help you know what to do when you are assigned this role.</p>
