		<p>Night of party is a role play game based on communication and stragety. Players were assigned different roles
			and
			they should act by their alignment. Through reasoning and exchanging issues to guess othersâ€™ role. As days
			pass
			more and more confirmed role will shows and the truth will reveal.</p>
		<p>The idea of Night Of Party originates from Town of Salem, Mafia and DnD, the style of UI were taken from my
			last
			game AnotherPlanet. The game has different modes which contain various roles of unique abilities and
			features.
			Also it has single(offline) mode and multiple(online) mode.</p>
