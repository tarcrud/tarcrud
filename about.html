<p>Based in Nanjing, born in ...( it changes every several years, from 96 to possible
    01 ).</p>
<p>One addicted to music, been composing novels for around 10 years, and somehow a
    loler or a loser.
    Definitely I'm single as always, to some extend defined to be stuck in. A work-life-balanced
    executor,
    which means being poor in all time.</p>
<p>I basically work with Android since 2019, originated from a desire to make a simple
    mobile game which later
    turns out of a lot unexpected additions. The website began in 2021 and run all by tarcrud( which
    means me ).</p>
<p>If u've got any problems with life or career please don't touch me, I'm not a
    professor in any area, I can
    only be me. So if u like me u could just donate.</p>
